And he managed to do it all in ONE YEAR.

The gist is that he made a distribution deal after shopping this around and WB won the bidding war. Total budget around 90m so this needs to make 180m to break even. But with his track record (2 billion tix for his previous movies) this should be no problem.

Apparently this is a ONE-OFF deal and similar to Tarantino's deal for Once upon a Time in Hollywood. 

But deals such as this are always going to be RARE and reserved for the very TOP talent who can bring everything to the project.

You can learn a lot just by studying someone’s career from afar.

I had time to reflect and ended up mapping his filmography to the founder journey:

🟥 Early-Stage Startup → Fruitvale Station (2013)

Theme: Start with purpose. Build from personal truth.

⬛ Post-PMF Startup → Creed (2015)

Theme: Balance legacy with originality. Prove you can win on a bigger stage.

🟪 Growth-Stage → Black Panther (2018)

Theme: Scale with intentionality. Protect the soul of your brand.

🟧 Enterprise → Sinners (2025)

Theme: Reinvent at the top. Stay culturally bold, even when you’re the establishment.

Most brands grow and lose what made them matter.

Coogler didn’t.

That’s the lesson.

It’s proof that understanding (not just knowing) the culture your audience subscribes to isn’t a side skill.

It’s your growth advantage.",0.2272727272727272,"race, music, religion"

Just chiming in since none of the replies knew any better: the word you wanted is ""purist"".",0.25,
reddit,"I feel like you're kind of misrepresenting why exactly Nolan was pissed off by Warner. Yes, covid restrictions and the pull back from theatrical roll outs played a role. But his main issue was how Warner made that decision without consulting the people who are largely responsible for creating and producing their assets. It wasn't about Nolan being a ""cinema purist"" but more about protecting worker's and union rights:


>Christopher Nolan, who has supplied Warner Bros. with multiple blockbusters, has expressed deep dissatisfaction with the studio’s decision to release its entire 2021 theatrical slate simultaneously on the HBO Max streaming service
“There’s such controversy around it, because they didn’t tell anyone,” said Nolan. “It’s very, very, very, very messy. A real bait and switch. Yeah, it’s sort of not how you treat filmmakers and stars and people who, these guys have given a lot for these projects. They deserved to be consulted and spoken to about what was going to happen to their work.”


>The studio stunned Hollywood on Dec. 3 with its announcement that all 17 of its 2021 titles — including the fourth “Matrix,” “The Suicide Squad,” “Godzilla v. Kong,” “Dune” and “In the Heights” — would debut on HBO Max immediately upon their theatrical release as parent WarnerMedia faces the prospect of moviegoers continuing to shun theaters. Nolan’s said his reaction was “disbelief….especially the way in which they did.”


>“In 2021, they’ve got some of the top filmmakers in the world, they’ve got some of the biggest stars in the world who worked for years in some cases on these projects very close to their hearts that are meant to be big-screen experiences,” he added. “They’re meant to be out there for the widest possible audiences… and now they’re being used as a loss-leader for the streaming service — for the fledgling streaming service — without any consultation.”


>“The economics of it are unsound unless you’re purely looking at movements in share price, number of eyeballs on the new streaming service. Theatrical is really only one part of what we’re talking about here. You’re talking about your home video window, your secondary tertiary windows. These are things very important to the economics of the business and to the people who work in the business. And I’m not talking about me. I’m not talking about Ben Affleck,” Nolan said.


>The director expressed anguish for members of unions like the Screen Actors Guild and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.
“I’m talking about the grips, the electricians who depend on, you know, IA and IA residuals for pension and health care. I’m talking about SAG. I’m talking about actors. I’m talking about when I come on the set and I’ve got to shoot a scene with, you know, a waiter or a lawyer who has two or three lines. They need to be earning a living in that profession, working maybe sometimes a couple of days a year. And that’s why the residuals structure is in place. That’s why the unions have secured participations for people down the line,” Nolan continued.


>The director called the decision by WarnerMedia, owned by tech giant AT&T, as devaluing billions in film assets “by using them as leverage for a different business strategy without first figuring out how those new structures are going to have to work, it’s a sign of great danger for the ordinary people who work in this industry.”


>Dealmaking in the age of streaming has been a tenuous proposition. Market leader Netflix crafted a model that would compensate filmmakers and talent for projected backend participation based on box office performance, one that HBO Max has only been in the nascent stages of iterating since it launched. The lack of structure on these streaming deals has serious impact on long term compensation for lesser-known working actors, Nolan said.


>“There is a danger with that that needs to be addressed through appropriate negotiation with unions, with talent and all the rest. There are enormous number of questions that come out of that about the economic structures that allow working people in Hollywood to maintain, you know, their lives and raise their families and have health care and all the rest. And I’m saying these are all things that haven’t yet been thought through and they need to be,” Nolan said.


>Finally, and not surprisingly, Nolan lamented for the health of movie theaters. “It’s very important that everybody remember the exhibition business provides hundreds of thousands of jobs for ordinary people. And my work has only ever got out there in the world because of the hard work of people working in those businesses,” the director said. “They need to be taken into account as we’re looking at how our work is shown and where it’s shown and how the business moves forward.”

Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, and Patty Jenkins got payouts equivalent to what the first Wonder Woman made at the box-office for WW84 according to reports from industry trades. Considering the lukewarm reception to that movie, the move to streaming probably got everyone a lot more money than they would have with a traditional gross percentage deal. The Witches is another one where Zemeckis and Hathaway got a big payout based on hypothetical gross; that movie would have absolutely bombed at the box-office, so they also got a way better deal with the streaming shift. Nolan was against this sort of move for Tenet, which is why WB dropped it in theaters at the height of COVID and it flopped. He probably lost a good chunk of money by just not taking the estimated gross for a straight-to-streaming release considering that film didn’t really resonate with a mainstream audience and COVID kept everyone away from theaters.

I'd pick gerwig over Peele too but Narnia makes her case weird. all numbers from The Numbers, global box office.

I like peele. he made 3 movies so far. all non IP horrors that made ~250 globally for get out and Us and 170 for Nope. good results tho nope at 68 budget seems to barely have broken even (68*2.5 is exactly 170). but we have no clue how he would do with an IP or outside horror or if he even wants to. and in a box office share a horror only guy can only get so far cos there's ton of people who won't watch horror. most a horror has ever done was 700 for It Chapter 1, which was wildly successful. so even if he keeps pumping out a 250 BO movies (and his 3rd did worse than previous two, despite Us imo being his clearly worst movie), you need 4 of those for a bil. while there still are IP movies that will make bil even post COVID.

coogler is on his 5th directional most of his were IP, one was IP/franchise he helped create tho (Creed). having rocky helps but that franchise stood firm even without Stallone in the end. Black panther did 1.3 bil, wakanda forever 860 post COVID, Creed 175. debut (Fruitvale station) was solid 17 mln box office for small 900k budget too. so he could handle MCU, wakanda is one of few hits in later phases and a franchise he helped start has grown. and his first original is getting great reviews and looking like 40-50 opening in us so prolly will get similar result to what Peele usually had but time will tell. A on cinemascore for a horror adjacent movie (which sinners got, for reference Get Out A-, Us B, Nope B) also is pretty unprecedented.

Greta has 3 director credits, Lady bird did 80, Little women 220, Barbie 1.4 bln. solid for little women (which is IP), surprisingly great for barbie. probably barbenheimer played a part but regardless she has highest grossing movie of those 3 directors and barbie made 2x more than entire Peele career. but for her the biggest thing is we have no clue how Narnia Netflix deal will shape next part of her career. if it's all 7 books and that's all she does in that frame (and it might take up her next decade or even more). and who the hell knows if she actually does get them released in cinemas cos its Netflix, they do release their stuff sometimes (i.e. I saw Hit Man in cinema) but hard to predict how they would do box office wise cos a lot of people would prolly just watch it on Netflix over going to cinema.",0.1056122448979592,"race, music"

>!Remik talks about how 'they' brought over the words of the Lord's Prayer to his people. 'They' stole his family's land, ect. The theory others have put out is that this is talking about the Roman expeditions to Ireland, but I think he is talking about the English persecution of Irish Catholics around 1600. Those 'words' would've been brought over by the Protestants and the King James Bible in an attempt to convert the Irish. They also banned Latin mass in an attempt to force out Catholicism. Irish Catholics were banned from owning land, and ownership was then stripped from those who didn't convert. Any who fought against this were forced into indentured servitude and shipped off to work on Caribbean plantations. These indentured servants were eventually replaced with African slaves. The main currency in the Caribbean (even in British colonies) were Spanish Doubloons. The use of this coin subtly draws more parallels between the persecution of these groups.!<

Sinners has a budget of between $93-100m.  Typically a film needs to at least double its budget to break even once marketing is taken into account.  Sometimes I've seen 2.5x quoted.  There's no guarantee at all that it will even reach the low end of that.

Instead explore the brothers upbringing, journey, family and the business ownership in a predominantly white man owned state. Explore the racial injustice side of things and delve into the war between the brothers and the two robberies that could be catching up to them. Also the klan members and the native Americans could all have been incorporated. Most importantly you could have kept basically all the good musical scenes and the story structure but switch out the dancing vampires with a hostile threat such as the klan burning down the dance club? And a few deaths later and completely destroyed the brothers or brother would have to find a way to retaliate!!! Maybe even bringing preacher boy into the mix and give him a conflicting stance because of his Christian backstory. Would have kept me on the edge of my seat. 
       PS- loved the music also could have shown and proved after the hypothetical “fire” that the music speaks to the living and the dead.

The rest were a cash grab. Halloween 2 came out after Friday the 13th, when people just wanted to see more murders and death scenes. The rest were ridiculous with the curse and all of that b.s.

The film somehow manages to infuse the vampire movie framework with layers you don't typically get from it (joy, musicality, reverie) alongside layers you absolutely expect from it (thrill, sorrow, tension). It's a got a sequence in the mid-2nd-act that I'm still thinking about two days later. Is the writing a bit overloaded and jumbled in spots? Yes. But even these flaws are counter balanced with a palpable passion and thoughtfulness too rarely seen in this scale of filmmaking. I haven't even really touched on the movie from a technical and craft perspective yet. Suffice to say, every department is working at the top of their games. The IMAX 65mm and Ultra Panavision 70 cinematography is stunning. Really, really, recommend people see this movie in the theaters, in IMAX, if possible.

reddit,"One thing about the movie that throws me off. Stack leaves Sammie alive and keeps his promise, which to me means he can make his own choices, and can actively choose to do the right thing at any given time. So why was he trying to kill his brother? I guess maybe while Remmick was still “alive”, Stack was under the control of the hive-mind and then gained autonomy after Remmick’s death? Mary seemed genuinely upset about Annie being killed, which means she had her wits about her too? So why’d she bite Smoke? My only head-canon is that Remmick’s influence over them kind of forced them. Evident by the singing in unison. Damn. Stack should’ve turned. Could’ve ran with his brother for a millennia.

reddit,"The kind of film where you know the movie gods were right beside them as they were making it.

Ryan Coogler's films deal with the struggle of identity within a system trying to suppress you. Whether it's Oscar Grant trying to become a better version of himself in Fruitvale Station, Adonis Creed wrestling with his father’s legacy to create an identity of his own, or King T'Challa struggling with his role as a king—balancing tradition and duty with the need to make reparations for the past and forge a new path forward.
Ultimately, Coogler's films are about what it means to live as a person in a world that won’t let you—and how power, history, and love collide in that pursuit. Sinners, in that regard, might be his biggest and best culmination of that yet.

Set in Jim Crow–era Mississippi, it’s about two brothers returning home and trying to start over, only to be confronted by an even bigger evil—the supernatural kind.

Sinners, while it will be marketed as a Michael B. Jordan movie, is really the story of a young kid named Sammie (played brilliantly by debutant Miles Caton). It’s through Sammie and his music that we become part of this world. His blues isn’t a form of entertainment—it’s a form of self-expression and spiritual awakening that pushes back against those who seek to exploit him.

The film sheds light on how Black art—especially music—is co-opted, commodified, and stripped of its cultural roots for white profit and pleasure. Through Sammie’s music, we hear echoes of resilience, sorrow, and survival. His music becomes an archive of history, and through it, he manages to create an identity of his own.",0.2670183982683982,"race, religion"

In the end the old man says that the day he spent revelling in his culture was the best day of his life, until night time (assimilation) came and literally sucked the life out of it.

reddit,"If I am allowed to put my thoughts into words, then ‘Sinners’, perhaps, is a homage to the African-American ethos that has seeped deep into the post modern American culture and has shaped its music over many centuries. ‘Sinners’ is also a social commentary on the racial profiling that’s so prevalent in contemporary world. ‘Sinners’ is about those communities that are often overlooked, individuals who are labeled before they’re even understood. ‘Sinners’ doesn’t glorify struggle like your average Oscar bait films that mistakes extremities of torture meted to persons of colors as ‘Torture Porn’. Instead, it exposes the quiet battles people face every day — the moral gray zones, the compromises, the moments of truth that don’t come with easy answers.

‘Sinners’ is also about music.  Not just as mere sound, but as a form of healing, a source of confession, an angst that’s waiting to be released. There’s a sequence in the second act that’s so visually arresting that it borders on being hypnotic. The song ‘I lied to you’ breaks all boundaries of time and brings together the past, present and future of music - all jiving on the same symphony, letting it reach for the divine! In times to come, during the annals of filmmaking, this scene will be talked forever! 

Do not watch this film thinking this as just another horror film. ‘Sinners’ is Blues without shackles. ‘Sinners’ is Rock-n-roll on LSD. ‘Sinners’ is anything, but a ghost story!",0.0462962962962962,race

reddit,"Honest Review (Spoilers) : 6.5/10

Pros: Visually, Sinners is stunning. So happy to see premium settings, costume design, and VFX in a Black-led supernatural project! Glowing-eyed creatures aren't necessarily fresh, but they nailed it with the gleaming irises and overall look of the vampires. The lore combining hoodoo, spirits, magic, and vampires was such a compelling concept but fits more into a TV series format. Favorite scenes are Mary going outside to ask if they’re good people and when Grace screams at the vampires to come inside.

Standout performances from Wunmi Mosaku, Hailee Steinfeld, Li Jun Li, Delroy Lindo, and Jack O’Connell. And shoutout to Lola Kirke, if that was her real voice during the banjo solo, it was absolutely heavenly.

Cons: The film takes over an hour establishing characters before any real conflict kicks in, which slows the pacing a lot. I wouldn’t even categorize Sinners as horror. More a magical drama with musical elements. The southern accents were super inconsistent and pulled me out of the experience.

Ryan’s writing and direction didn’t land for me. The vampire lore felt painfully uninspired. Michael B. Jordan’s performance also felt oddly flat/contrived. Maybe it’s the twin dynamic or just the writing, but it didn’t connect for me. The whole “preacher boy” plotline with powers to animate the dead and future sets up something that’s so compelling, but doesn’t deliver a satisfying payoff. The ending shootout with the KKK felt like an unnecessary tonal shift & second climax in the plot.

I was hoping for a more nuanced, layered script. Still, I wouldn’t say don’t watch it but definitely go in with tempered expectations. And yes, it’s more of a musical than you’re probably expecting (or wanting lol).",0.2263513513513513,race

It is fairly on the nose that the Duke Club is a refuge that represents black culture and the Vampires represent the world at large who is trying to steal or appropriate that sense of identity. Throughout the film the vampires seem to be looking for some kind of mutual understanding, to share in the culture (ie. enter the club), is that really a bad thing? I fully support celebrating the art, music and history of different cultures, but this film wasn't doing that, it said this is our culture and it is not for you, if we share it, it will be ruined. It feels like a self imposed cultural segregation, which is regressive to say the least.",0.0356349206349206,race
reddit,"Vampires in the traditional sense are closer to 30-40% of the film & serve as an artistic expression of hive mind thinking, exploitative evil, etc (how you interpret the film).

The movie was more of a representation of a people not far removed from the harshest existence in American history & trying to find their way with the systemic fangs (vampires) still present all around them yet still finding inspiration & beauty in harsh conditions.

This was communicated through sharecropping.

In the movie and in the south in reality sharecropping was paid through plantation credits (fake money).

many would say this is slavery. 

Paying workers in fake money while you benefit from their work financially is a metaphor of vampires sucking life force from their victims but the vampires in that situation were the people who benefited from the hard workers as they made them wealthier.

reddit,"As the summer season begins, Sinners is both its starting line and its standout star performer.

Drawing inspiration from the editing techniques seen in *Oppenheimer*, *Sinners* intricately weaves narrative threads through its persistent soundtrack, which functions almost as a character in its own right. The film employs music not merely as an accompaniment but as a crucial element that constructs the backdrop of its narrative — a tapestry of magic, oppression, and struggle that underpins the rich historical context of American music.

This film is a compelling synthesis of a Robert Johnson biopic, Streets of Fire, and Near Dark, showcasing Ryan Coogler's mastery in a Tarantino-esque manner. The film is marked by daring directorial decisions that meld seamlessly with moments of visceral violence. Notably, there are segments where the narrative interrupts its momentum to savor musical performances, elevating these moments to the same level of intensity as the film’s most grueling confrontations. This might well be Coogler’s magnum opus, undeniably his most genre-bending work, expertly combining elements of pulp fiction with deep thematic resonance. The film subverts traditional vampire motifs while imbuing the well-worn ‘let me in’ trope with a fresh and playful twist, reminiscent of the BBC’s  Dracula but distinctly its own.

The cast delivers outstanding performances, yet the film's foundation rests squarely on the actor portraying Sammy. His portrayal serves as the narrative's driving force; without his singular performance, the film’s impact would be significantly diminished. This role appears to have been conceived for him, making it an unparalleled fit that underscores the narrative's potency.

However, one critique arises: the meticulously constructed world languishes when the focus shifts to overt violence, which disrupts the meticulously built tension. Yet, the film's intensity is so captivating that one is reluctant to see it fade as the credits begin to roll — a testament to its engaging storytelling.

 Sinners will resonate with die-hard dramatists and mainstream audiences, captivating even those typically averse to less cerebral cinema. Its ability to engage viewers in thoughtful post-screening discussions speaks to its multifaceted nature and will reward those who stick around to discuss once the credits start to roll.",0.22578231292517,music

reddit,"Bro I am so upset by this film
 
Mostly because I was so fucking hyped for it 




1. Throw away the first hour to hour and a half. Nothing in it mattered. The exposition was really long, and it inhibited immersion by delaying the magic. Bad writing. Instead, establishing the magic early with Sammie doing some small version of the music magic and getting his ass beat for it by daddy preacher would have been awesome.


2. Truly no one cares about who is fucking who. Especially since it didn't even become important later. The ""oh no my lady"" shut didn't even hold water because they showed the same level of ""oh no"" over the random dude who got passed out drunk and oopsie expelled. 


3. They couldn't afford the natives for more than one scene? I was expecting them to come back at some point 


4. So... The witch lady's sole contribution was that she knew the stuff about vampires literally everyone knows. Shocked she didn't have to tell us they drink blood or have sharp teeth. Wasted. Utterly wasted. 


5. So the magic powers didn't get useful either? Sammie didn't get to summon warriors to help? How fucking awesome would it have been to play some badass music and get some past and future team ups. Have some Zulus with spears and some spaceman level stuff and actual irl black heros kicking vampire ass. But no. We gotta spend fifteen minutes lecturing him about how to properly lick pussy. 


6. Delta Slim not being secretly also a vampire but from a different seethe the whole time is a rip off. You telling me this old ass man somehow spry as fuck, stronger than a young person, fending off vamps one handed, can't eat garlic, but nah he just a dude? Fuuuuuck that. Also lame.


7. The villain vampire leader guy is stupid. Oh no he might make us dance---the thing we came here and paid money to do. Scary!!!


8. Seriously. The CONCEPT was amazing but the EXECUTION was trash. 


9. I'm glad Grace let them in. Fuck yeah. Good job! They ain't gonna let you go fight and save your kid? Fuck them. 


10. They established the car was ""too fast"" but never drove it fast??? Dafuq???


11. They established the KKK guy and hinted at him coming back but he didn't???


12. They established needing invite but then Mary got invited and didn't turn around and invited the rest in???


13. Why did vampy mcboss do a baptism??? ""Almost dawn better kill time instead of winning""


14. Was he puppetting them? Or they just high in endorphins loving him? Or??? Be clear. Confusing isn't fear.",0.0201167385057471,"race, music"

Story was all over the place and it spend too much time on pointless exposition and left interesting threads (plot and character arcs) at a surface level.

Maybe show a little bit how the brothers double-crossed the outfit in Chicago and that both of them wanted to go back home to the women they love as they are both tired of warring.

Then at the showdown at the juke joint , have the Klan and the Chicago mob arrive and see them getting attacked and have the few survivors seek refuge in the juke joint, maybe even a moment of reconciliation  between the Klan, mob and brothers, as they fight for survival.

During the  fight have the Indians come in heavy handed  (why did they leave the house in the 1st place, they had the numbers and could've ended it right there) and have one of them explain what they are facing, instead of voodoo lady.

And maybe explain what the Buddy Guy power means in all of it and weave that into the story, maybe have him play around the world to attract vampires, so that these Indian hunters can kill them.

reddit,"Awful film

0/10 review

Why?

Too hyperactive. No subtlety. No, nothing.

No empathy for any characters at all (not a game winner but this added to the major flaws of this film).

Horrible music score. The wail-y blues esque guitar with synth and sorta strings was woeful. Keep it subtle film makers or should I say producers/movie studio big wigs.

The first half of the movie dragged on wayyy too long and by that time of entering the “stand off finale”..I’d checked out. My 14 year old daughter had too.

It felt like they were attempting some sort of “assault on precinct 13” (John Carpenter 1976 version) but it missed the mark and fell off a cliff.

I’m still digesting how terrible it was.

Why are people enjoying this? What the hell was this film?

It was pure awful tripe. Watch “Near Dark” or “Assault on Precinct 13” (1976 version) instead.

In the bin.

reddit,"I just came home from watching Sinners and honestly i was really proud by what he chose to focus on. We didn't get slave porn, or trauma porn. 

We got characters who a had agency, had great juicy roles from everyone. We got a post credit scene. We got a script with really good writing, afro surrealism, and a camera that worked hard to give exposition instead of just talking the audience to death with lore.

It was beautiful I think I may have cried twice. And it had alot of room to breath for a film that felt like it only really had one plot going on. It felt long despite being a short enough story with a strong buildup so that we love and see every character fleshed out.

We got a celebration of music and dance from several cultures, we were shown appreciation through participation. We had black people, African people, black American futures, asian people, indian people, and even white/european dancing and singing and pulling from all cultures.

This wasn't really a film about hate between races in fact I think this was more a film about unification despite differences, until the very end we were reminded that the only real enemies are the ones that commit genocide like the Klan.

I think at the end of the day ignoring the beautiful spectacle it had great messages and the music was even better. It really smartly laid down their scoring to every dialogue so that there is a baseline of emotion throughout the entire script. You can hear the crowd lynching someone at the train station as he tells a story from memory. Another great exposition is without being told the location of their hometown we understand it's segregated without having to focus on segregation. We get one fantastic sequence of an Asian family who either works or owns two separate markets one for colored people and one for white people

reddit,"Just watching this film, excuse the lateness. The head white vamp was Irish. At first I thought it was weird that the vamp wasn't British and representing colonialism, but then in the scene where he joins Sammie in reciting the Bible verse, I believe it was, he basically says a line that tells how his people were subjugated by the same oppressive hand (the church) and he came to know it was a comfort. The Irish have a similar history to many black cultures around the world in that they were also colonised by the crown. The start of the film ties African and Celtic culture together as having powerful art that traces back through time, or their own cultural narrative (specifically music history) that another culture wants to steal/exploit. These settled countries are perfect for these stories as the Irish were often shipped there (e.g. Australia) as criminals and suffered similarly poor treatment as the indigenous people. So the head Celtic having them all perform a jig was more representing his deep cultural ties to his people and trying to show the black people that assimilating into white culture and sharing their rich unique history was the way to immortality (vampires represent this), but really was ""selling the soul"" of black people, and the vampires were all those that had turned to the temptation offered by white cultural vampires, or had their hand forced. I loved the idea that music is storytelling art across time and that there were deep cultural roots for the different characters that the church was actually pulling them from. The church was flipped here, and was not salvation from evil, the vampires actually represented its end product, a shared cultural narrative to the exclusion of all others. Here the church is salvation forced upon a culture from the other that took it in the first place.

reddit,"The scene where Remmick recites the Lord’s Prayer with Sammie reinforces this take. 

Remmick tells Sammie that the men who took his father’s land brought the Lord’s Prayer with them, which is a reference to the Christianization of Ireland. Irish-Gaelic culture was assimilated to fit into Christian faith, with their history, lore and gods being twisted to fit with church doctrine. So while it was preserved in a sense, it would never be what it once was. 

Remmick is also an agent of assimilation; he can’t add to culture or create it, he can preserve it in a sense thru the memories of his victims but is cut off from participation. The Irish Jig he does, great as it was, resembles more a robotic imitation of a human dance with how perfectly choreographed it was, in contrast to the more vibrant, messy music and dance in the hall. He craves culture and community but can only create more hungry thralls like himself. 

This might also play into Sammie’s choice to leave his father’s church at the end. He could have chosen the safety of his father and life as a preacher, rejecting music. But instead I think part of him saw he would just be assimilating into another unchanging collective instead of living.

The piano player tells Sammie ""Christianity was forced on us, music is what's really ours""

It is far from a perfect movie (i.e., it tries to do way too much narratively, a lot of the humour falls flat, and it struggles with trying to balance its emotional weight with the demands of being another instalment setting up future film projects), but it’s one of even a handful of modern superhero films that actually attempts to speak to themes and emotions that extend beyond its relationship to comic book IP, and which is more of a creative expression as opposed to just another set-up for a future Avengers flick. Personally, I’d take a filmmaker messily utilizing a comic book IP to interrogate his and his casts collective grief relating to the sudden loss of their collaborator and friend over a movie that only works emotionally if you’ve been invested in over 20 years of studio politics and corporate synergy (*Cough* Deadpool & Wolverine *Cough*)",0.1162698412698412,

Then I had a chance to see the 70mm IMAX at the AMC City Walk (also LA).  I actually thought the film print was quite dark compared to the Laser IMAX.  Still great but quite noticeably darker to my eye.  I actually preferred the Laser viewing in this case.

I saw Oppenheimer in 70mm IMAX  same theater and don't recall it looking so dark.  I'd like to see Sinners on the Grauman's Chinese theater which is also 70mm IMAX as well as the Vista here in town which is apparently an even rarer format according to Coogler.  We are spoiled in LA.

And the movie could've easily placed them in that camp and stuck with it, being worse for it of course.

Definitely added a lot to the movie and I'm glad the Irish music didn't exist as solely a kind of quirky juxtaposition to the blues.

If you just look at the movie on it's own it's clear that it will be in the ""10 most profitable movies of 2025"" list. Anyone denying that is an idiot.

If you look at what it does for Coogler in terms of future projects it's hard to argue with the asterisk at least for big budget movies. He has not directed a single movie that made more internationally than domestic.

For a mid-budget movie like Sinners that's perfectly fine, it also works if it's because the domestic BO is overperforming like it was with the Black Panther movies which were pretty much 50/50. But a split with 75% domestic will not be enough for a $200-$250 million movie to be profitable, that split just doesn't scale high enough.

reddit,"I'm sorry, but I think there's a big difference between Superman having parallels to an Ancient Greek myth and Mickey 17 being a *direct adaptation* of a novel called Mickey7.

I think the broad point is whether something is inspired by a work or is a direct adaptation. Superman and Lion King play off themes and broad points from these other works, but they clearly function as their own distinct works. You can watch Lion King and Hamlet and consider them very different original stories, just as you can with Superman and Hercules.

Meanwhile, Mickey 17 is a direct adaptation: same plot, same setting, same characters, almost the same title. It's just moving from literature to film. In Mickey 17, Mickey Barnes is on the crew of a spaceship trying to colonize an ice planet called Niflheim and he signs up to be an ""Expendable"" meaning that when he dies, he is replaced with a clone of himself with his memories, but due to an error he is accidentally cloned before he dies. In Mickey7, Mickey Barnes is a member on the crew of a spaceship trying to colonize an ice planet called Niflheim and he signs up to be an ""Expendable"" meaning that when he dies, he is replaced by a clone of himself with his memories, however due to an error he is accidentally cloned before he dies and now there are two of him.

By contrast, Hercules is about the son of Zeus and a mortal woman. He is a demigod but gets sent to Earth and raised as a human child. Hercules grows up to become a hero, slaying monsters and eventually undergoes the 12 Labours. Then he dies and goes to Olympus. Superman is about the son of two aliens living on the planet Krypton. The planet is about to be destroyed so his parents send him away in a pod which crashes on Earth. Superman is raised by human parents, but his alien physiology gives him special abilities and he uses these to become a hero. The broad strokes are the same, but quite a bit is different and tries to do its own thing.

That isn't remotely the same thing. Superman takes broad points but does something unique with them while Mickey 17 is literally the same work. All the differences between the book and movie are pretty superficial, such as the mistaken clone being number 18 instead of number 8. The only real plot difference is the ending. But it's the same story.

It's not splitting hairs. One is its own thing, the other isn't. And ""original"" doesn't mean having a soul, it means being *original*.",0.0748782467532467,religion

We have two IMAX screens (Cineworld in Parnell Street Dublin and ODEON in Blanchardstown Dublin), but neither is exactly 1:90, so they are LieMAX.

I'm willing to bet the other person and the vast majority of people don't assume anywhere close to only 3-4 movies a year if advocating for the value of watching movies in theaters. I'd assume an actual floor of a general movie goer, very generously, to go at least once a month, 12 times in one year. That's $180 minimum, without any snacks, and that's just ONE year. That's meeting the comparison head on without hourly value.

This is all a ridiculous premise. You have no leg to stand on here and you're grasping at the smallest of straws. Movies in theaters have other merits for recreation, it's not the end of the world to acknowledge the cost factors don't stack up positively in this one area.",0.0821163245356793,

Why give someone your ID or anything with your fingerprints...to rob them?


At the airport in those years they would just tell you to pull the mask down to match the face to ID.

I do think you minimized the encounter and I was further explaining it for someone who may come across your comment and believe it




You said they briefly arrested him and let him go. Did you watch the body cam video? They tapped him on the shoulder and pulled out guns.


You said your coworker and you joked as bank employees because of how suspicious his attire looked. I said it was a COVID mask (not a ski mask and the whole bank wore masks including the tellers), his glasses looked like transitions (not dark shades hiding his pupils).and he wore a light green shirt. It didn't look suspicious at all. So in a sense you guys did joke that he did this to himself






He handed her his ID


He also used his bank card in the machine and his pin number.


Why didn't you share that your coworkers discussed how she should've verified his ID with bank account by having him lower the mask. Complete a CTR or whatever. 


You've mentioned at least twice that the bank teller was Black but that doesn't mean anything when it comes to racially profiling. That's how systemic racism works. Anti-Blackness and implicit bias are things descending from white supremacy working as intended. Black police officers also killed unarmed Black men standing with their white coworkers because the NYPD 's supremacist roots supersede some kind of imaginative race loyalty.... but let's not have that conversation. (Which is why I skipped over that in your comments). Maybe if this was a post on Coogler's ""Fruitvale Station"" instead of ""Sinners"" I'd trust the conversation could take it...






Point is - She told her manager he was a robber and the manager endangered his life for $12,000. The teller was pregnant but a gun was not on her, he hadn't threatened her or told her not to move.


It was a quiet day in the bank and she walked away safely from him. She didn't appear in danger.


..he was patiently waiting , scrolling his phone as multiple cops approached him.




The other tellers had no idea an alleged dangerous robber was next to them and the 911 operator was confused by the call..

I think having the KKK not have really be any part of the movie besides the twins buying the land and then a line where the Irish dude mentions they were going to burn it down never really made them seem like a threat because it was brought up when they were fighting motherfucking vampires. They gotta defeat supernatural evil first before even worrying about human evil.

It's still the norm to have a mixture of adaptations, sequels, remakes and originals every year since the 1910s (studio-financed or not). It wasn't unusual for a movie to be remade at least twice within ten years through the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, either. 

A lot of well-made movies were ignored for decades until they found their moment in the sun. Such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946), an adaptation and a box-office failure and forgotten until the 1980s.

People tend to forget that these box-office successes are remakes: The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Thing (1982), A Star Is Born (1954) (Judy Garland), The Departed (2006), The Maltese Falcon (1941) (Humphrey Bogart), Airplane! (1980), The Birdcage (1996), The Fly (1986), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), True Lies (1994), Heat (1995), Ocean's 11 (2001), Scarface (1983), The Ten Commandments (1956) (Charlton Heston) and more.

reddit,"I think this discussion reveals a lot about where we think culpability begins and ends. In your interpretation, becoming one of the vampires means you have no control over any of your actions, i.e., you’re NOT yourself. I disagree—the characters retain all their memories and knowledge of their past relationships; the *only* thing that changes is their allegiance. That is what the vampirism is—an induction into a hive mind where everyone has a singular goal. But everyone otherwise retains their mannerisms, memories, etc. 

I don’t think the vampirism makes you NOT-you, I think it makes you into someone wholly opposite of who you were, because you’re suddenly willing to harm people you otherwise loved. It can seem like the same thing as being not-yourself, but I feel it’s an important distinction because it’s a commentary on a larger social problem. People who assimilate to an oppressive group don’t stop being people. They just stop caring about people. 

Irrespective of that disagreement, we both agree she was foolish. And that foolishness was a betrayal. I don’t think it’s an accident that she is the character who sets this chain of events in motion, and I do feel her identity was meant to inform that. It’s not a blanket indictment of mixed race people, but it is a frank statement about intra racial relations.

As I mentioned in another comment, Coogler is similarly critical of East Asians when it comes to solidarity. Grace betrays the group too. And take a look at Grace’s husband. His first instinct is to get the car to get himself and his wife away from danger; everyone else be damned.

Annie, our in-universe vampire expert, says as much. She tells Smoke “that thing in there is not your brother.” My interpretation is supported by the characters in the film who are at risk of being inducted into this hivemind against their will by the people they love. Is a Stack who would bite down as Annie begs and cries still Stack? I would say no. I would say becoming something wholly opposite of who you were, despite retained memories and mannerism, is effectively the same as no longer being yourself. Literal KKK members, people whose belief in white supremacy is so deeply held that they’ve got a lynching to attend in the morning, are suddenly talking about unity and love. 

You said in your first comment that the vampires offered Mary fellowship and love. We clearly see Mary reject that offer, and she gets forcibly assimilated anyway. So no, I do not think the Mary in the first half of the film is culpable for the actions of the Mary in the second half. As you said, she is wholly opposite of who she was. It’s a distinction without a difference. 

> And that foolishness was a betrayal. 

It was foolishness Stack agreed to. And it wasn’t without risk to Mary herself. Aside from the obvious, being a woman alone and outnumbered at night, far enough from the juke that no one can hear her scream, this is 1930s Mississippi. She’s not a white woman with black ancestry, she’s a negro. Stack tells her that if news of this gets back to Arkansas, they’ll kill her. 

> His first instinct is to get the car to get himself and his wife away from danger; everyone else be damned.

No it’s not. Bo literally says “the man just lost his brother, we can’t leave him.” It’s a solid minute or so of Grace telling him it’s not their fight and can’t get caught up in anything that means they don’t make it home to their daughter before he agrees to go. And while I understand Coogler choosing Grace to be the one to let the vampires in, her being the only person with a child to get home to also weakened it for me, which I’m sure is part of why Remmick picked her out as the weak link in the first place.

Uh, because making money is the primary reason these companies exist? Look, it's a good movie, but it was also a big risk from a financial standpoint simply because it's an original horror/period film. Two things can be true at once: 1) the film is good and highlights that Coogler is a solid director, and 2) any director, REGARDLESS of skin color, making this film for $90M is a gamble. 

And to everyone saying that if a white director had made this film that no one would care: you're wrong; we'd be having this same conversation. Also to those who think that the studios are OK with the performance of Gladiator II or Killers of the Flower Moon against their unforgivably high budgets: you're wrong too; I guarantee the entire industry is shifting away from those kinds of tent poles with the changing theater attendance. 

If Sinners had been made for $50M, $60M, hell, even $70M, we wouldn't be having this conversation. But $90M means the film has to probably make upwards of $200M to break even, which is a huge hurdle for a movie of its kind. I hope it does, and that it smashes it out of the park so that this encourages other films like it to be made, but let's not bemuse ourselves into thinking that it wasn't always going to have an uphill battle, no matter the director or stars.",0.1552380952380952,
reddit,"its not about ""how much it will make WB."" this PR offensive is a bit annoying, though it seems effective. And by that I mean both the ""this movie will ruin hollywood's economics"" AND the ""60m is a fantastic opening for a movie that cost 90m not including P&A"" PR efforts. These are specific narratives being pushed by interested parties and anyone reading them needs to be aware of that. 

This film's financial arrangement is not going to ruin hollywood. And 60m opening weekend is a problem number for the budget and P&A spend, especially in a world where the additional opportunities to recoup expenses and profit from ancillary rights sales (cable TV, dvd/bluray/UHD disc, airline use rights etc) have drastically shrunk. 

It may not be a problem number if the picture has serious spring break legs and sustains momentum through the following weekend, but it almost certainly has to hit above 200m at the box office to break even. And if what you care about is crossing the break even point, the box office numbers (unlike more easily manipulated streaming numbers) dont lie. 

But that is probably the wrong way to look at the whole situation if you are interested in hollywood, and why even ""underperforming"" this picture may be a win for WB.

The reality is the movie from the green light was unlikely to break even at its budget unless it was a smash hit, something very difficult for an R rated picture. Not impossible, but very difficult. One might even say extremely difficult given the available, modern comps. 

The film, rather, is a major investment by WBD in a relationship with Coogler. It is also more broadly part of a swing for the fences on original, director driven film approach the current WBD team chose to make in the hopes one or two of the pictures might be a runaway hit. 

There is also oscar buzz around it now, which is its own value to a studio who literally lost the trust of Nolan and is trying to recover. They need their new Nolan. 

So though that lens, the investment becomes clear. its about getting filmmakers wanting to work with WBD after the reputation hit they took from burying those movies for tax writeoffs. And if in the process the studio makes a great film, all the better for everyone. 

Personally I hope WB's efforts pay off in the sense that they bring back the ""one for the studio, one for me"" way of making films. It kept mid budget, more performance and artistic driven films in production while also making sure those big hits were still being made. 

And if we bring back directors as a brand as a thing, which Coogler has so far managed to do for himself, thats another thing that can drive people into theaters again. And thats good for everyone.",0.127649306475837,

Now that theaters are in the shits and streaming wars are in full swing, it's a very different discussion and one that studios are likely terrified will pick up steam among top tier directors - meaning the ones most likely to create the next modern classics that endure for another 50 years.

Coogler asking for and getting this deal is phenomenal for him but terrible as an indicator of what talent might demand in the future. Studios recognize the danger they're in and what it represents. Personally, I'm all for Coogler and directors of his caliber getting what they deserve and maintaining ownership of their creative works.

It's well-documented that corporations don't just see green though, because they're run by people who sometimes have biases which aren't grounded in reality. You need look no further than the fact that it took decades for the billion dollar franchise of Black Panther to make it to the big screen, in part due to the, again, well-documented racism of executives like Ike Perlmutter. There are many examples of racism in Hollywood, and if Hollywood only saw green and was benevolent and all-knowing it would never put out the many flops it does.

Now, these biases aren't always grounded in malice, but perhaps simply in ignorance and assumptions. They exist nonetheless. And claiming one's colour blind doesn't mean one's vision is actually unclouded or seeing the full picture.

All that said, I don't know if racism is part of what's motivating the bizarrely critical commentary in some of the trades and from some studio executives when it comes to Sinners. Maybe it's all just down to studio politics, greed and ageism.

reddit,"YUP. Even when folks are like ""it's not that he's black, it's about the contract"" the contract is alarming to them because what they *don't* wanna say out loud is ""young Black directors shouldn't be getting that contract.""

**This is what's scaring the fuck out of these folks**: If Abdy/DeLuca gave him this deal, and it works out for them, then not only did every other studio who passed on it FUCK UP, clearly (*which they did*) - But *now* any other director will feel more justified in asking for the same thing, and studios are going to have a harder time turning them down. And the unspoken reason WHY they're going to have a harder time turning other directors down, is that **they don't value young Black directors as highly as they value mediocre white ones**. NOBODY does. NEVER HAVE.

So now that a young Black director got this deal, *and made good on it*, next time some mediocre white one will roll thru and say ""hey guess what, now it's my turn, you gave THAT GUY the sweet deal, there's no way I don't get it too..."" and there isn't a studio in the business right now not shitting itself at the prospect. Even now the calculus they're running, they might not even know they're running it consciously, the people going ""it's not race, it's the streaming libraries"" in the comments - the math is BASED on this simple value judgment: ""One of us got caught giving a good deal to a young Black director now we have no real leverage or justification not to give this same deal to the mediocre white ones we normally toss disproportionate bags at ALL THE TIME, FOR DAMN NEAR EVERYTHING."" Or to put it in even simpler terms: ""How do we say no to Shawn Levy next time he comes around after we just said yes to Ryan Coogler now?"" 

Of course that's not taking into account how many studio execs straight up SQUANDER their libraries as it is, who are merely reacting to the very *idea* they can't own all rights to this stuff in perpetuity - to fart away and fumble off to whoever in whatever firesale after falling short of whatever earnings potential way before 25 years are up - in a sort of purely fear-based spasmodic thrashing. Which is what this is. God forbid they recalibrate and WORK to establish a relationship with the talent that would lead talent to WANT to stay with the studio after 25 years pass because it's mutually beneficial. This *clearly* is anathema to them, the idea they should have to perform for the talent as much as the talent has to perform for them.

But **there is no aspect of this that isn't touched by some form of racism**. It's American business, the shit is built-in. It can't *not* be. You can't build this country, economically, the way it was, and not have it in every cell of the organism.

reddit,"It's not racism, it's the business threat.

Seriously, please try to think for a moment beyond racism because it's too easy to default to that as an excuse and miss the forest from the trees. Is systemic racism a problem in today's society? Absolutely.

But this isn't about Coogler as an individual or as a black man. It's entirely about the deal and the existential threat it represents to the studios. Right now their biggest asset is they own their filmographies. But those filmographies are only theirs for a limited time. Eventually (95-120 years after publication) those works will inevitably enter the public domain. This means that in the long term, there is a ticking clock. 

Now you have to factor in the deals that now exist. Tarantino got one in 2017 for 10-20 years on OUATIH with  Sony. Back then, this wasn't a big deal because we didn't have covid ravage the theatrical system worldwide and the streaming wars weren't in full swing just yet. But it's a very different story now. Coogler's deal for 25 years could be a turning point. Because now that's two filmmakers negotiating for and receiving this deal. What happens if Chris Nolan decides for the next movie after the Odyssey that he wants the same kind of deal? What if Denis Villeneuve asks for a similar deal after Dune 3? or Greta Gerwig after Narnia? 

As directors start to grow in clout and they recognize their power, it puts the studios in a position where their heavy hitters start realizing they can push for these deals. And that limits their ownership of IP if eventually the film rights revert to the creator in a shorter time span. They start getting cannibalized at both ends while still putting up the money to get these films made. And that in turn means they need to offer higher budgets and better deals to discourage this request in the future. All in all, it's a bad position for the studios for this deal to become normalized because they lose.

So I'm sorry to be blunt but in this issue they don't give a single fuck about Coogler being black: they care about the long term damage deals like his as precedent set for their prospects in the industry. They're terrified of creatives realizing they can push for these deals and the studios willing to cave and give it away.

I won't delete it fully but I just want to acknowledge that I was less than graceful and that the response below left me with something to consider. I was in the wrong.

 Tarantino got a similar deal in 2017 before covid and the streaming wars hit full swing. Now it's a completely different ballpark and a deal like Coogler's is a threat to the studio system's future. Deals where they only have the rights for 10 to 25 years put them at a disadvantage and make them temporary stewards rather than owners. It diminishes their hold over IP and that's a danger in a streaming environment, especially when you consider that currently copyright ownership and public domain chip away at the classics over the long term. That means if this becomes the norm, they could end up cannibalized out of their holdings between demands like this and public domain freeing films to the public.

Up until that assimilation took solid root, Irish Immigrant communities were heavily discriminated against and their communities were usually right along side black communities.

Here is a quote from the Smithsonian on that very topic:

> The commonalities of African Americans and Irish Americans in social status and economic standing could have set the two groups as allies, but the divide that ensued destroyed this likely union. While the Irish seized the opportunity they were presented to assimilate, African Americans continued to face racial prejudice and violence, sometimes even at the hands of the Irish, despite the relationships of abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Daniel O’Connell

Body snatchers is the best monster movie I can think of and that arguably doesn't even qualify as a monster movie.  ""The Thing"" was good.  ""Alien"" and ""Aliens""were good.  The problem with monster movies, I think, is that when you make humans into supernatural monsters that choice has to make sense for it to be other than superfluous to telling the story but upon closest inspection no human is ever other than human.  I think that makes picking out humans to make into monsters can't help but come off as a form of hateful othering.

I don't know.  It comes off as punching down.  It'd be interesting to see a werewolf movie where a ruling government turned into werewolves to the horror of their former allies and compatriots.

reddit,"It's different flavors of horror.

There's Existential Horror. Something like Annihilation, the Thing, or Alien or maybe Under the Skin (huh lots of aliens oddly enough) where the scare comes from facing something dangerous and unknown you can't quite understand the purpose or rules of. I'd include movies like Lake Mungo, Skinamarink, Possession, maybe It Follows. Existential Horror is about the fear of something new, something mysterious, something you can't quite understand or control even with modern technology and scientific analysis. Our characters try to impose control, understanding, comprehension, knowledge, planning on their lives and the world but the monster gradually evades and destroys that certainty and safety. Maybe the hero survives but their ordered world is certainly shattered and they're left with either a more nihilistic attitude to the universe or a tougher attitude to dealing with the struggle to survive.

Versus Folk Horror where the monster is something ancient and rule-following (Vampire movies, the Babadook, the Witch, Midsommar, the Skeleton Key, Poltergeist, Exorcist, The Shining, pretty much all movies about demons, ghosts, etc.) that you have to outsmart or outplay or negotiate with. Folk horror is very often about monsters that are trying to recruit you, make a deal with you, turn you, get out into their mindset. Folk Horror is about the fear of something old, something ritualistic that should have died a long time ago. Something that the more frightened, traditional humans in some past dark age knew how to deal with but comfortable modern people have forgotten about. I'd say a lot of J-horror is Folk Horror too. Folk Horror often involves characters struggling to resist the pull of the old ways and the seduction of the monster while simultaneously needing to get closer to the monster and learn its ways to understand how to deal with it—always a nice tension.

I think both types are great but this was definitely the latter.

Blues musicians, the best ones, draw in vampires, it doesn’t have to make sense just go with it. So there’s this preacher’s kid and he’s great at blues guitar. One day, twins who used to live in the Delta come home, dressed up and with money in their pockets. They have just robbed the Italian and Irish mobs in Chicago. The women they left behind are mad at them. Their plan is to open a juke joint. They want the preacher’s kid to play it. 

Then they open and play the blues and vampires show up, there are a couple more musical numbers, one twin gets bitten, the vampires forget the sun kills them (???) and they all die except the twin and his girlfriend (also a vampire now) who get a post credits scene in the 90s, the end. 

Oh the preacher’s kid has to choose between god and the blues and he picks the blues.

reddit,"We are going into spoiler territory here but here we go >!First and foremost I love Sammy's storyline. The parallel of Angel on one shoulder and the Devil on the other with his Father, a preacher, being the Angel and with Remmick being the Devil. Remmick is a mirror image to Sammy's father. He is a white man dressed in white playing the role of a preacher with his literal ""born again"" congregation praising him as he gives his sermon in song. (Compare this to Sammy's father when we see him wearing a black blazer at the service.) In Remmick's song and dance you see the people in the background circling him counterclockwise and that's supposed to mimic a ""ring shout"" which just even further sells that he is the mirror image of Sammy's preacher father. Sammy's father wants him to give up his music. Remmick wants his music. Wants Sammy to play. In the end, Sammy refuses to go to completely either side. He goes straight down the middle and does his own thing. The final scene we see of him is an after credit scene of him singing a blues version of ""This little light of mine."" A blend of the of what his preacher father called, ""The Devil's music"" and a well known religious folk song. Again, I love that story.!<

>!I love the actor. Heck, I love all the actors. I love the music of this movie. I loved how the ""Rocky Road to Dublin"" mimicked the twins journey to Chicago. Of how in the song, an Irish man leaves his hometown for opportunities only to find bigotry and hardship. I love the sweeping shots of landscapes. The cotton fields looked gorgeous. I love movement of the cameras. It reminded me of Spielberg. I love how the town looks lived in. I love the costumes. I freakin' love how we have Southern Asians for once. We never get that in movies or shows but they exist! I grew up in VA and now live in NC. They exist, Hollywood! Southern drawl and all. I love all the period accurate details like having the separate Black only and White only grocery stores run by the Chinese family. And the blink and you'll miss it tamale store as a period reminder of how there were Mexican migrants there as well working the fields. I love the look of the vampires. I loved Remmick's introduction and how he falls into the scene suggesting he was just flying. He stumbles in like a Fallen Angel.!<

It's wild to me that no one in the cast is from the South. California? New York? England? Ontario? Sure. Any of the Southern states? Nope. Not one. Also, everyone looked amazing.

The native Americans just kinda showed up in one scene and had nothing else to do with the movie. The vampires show up and do their thing (which is played for comedy mostly) and they just hang around until sunrise so they all die. Then next thing we know there's a gunfight with the Klansmen dudes and it's over.

It felt like the movie was at war with itself on what it was trying to accomplish. Lots of good ideas in there but they didn't tie it all together nicely.

If Black Panther was only nominated for Best Picture because the hero was black, I look forward to Brave New World's Best Picture nomination. I wonder how many Oscars Blade was nominated for, now that I think about it.

I believe Black Panther's success is due to a number of factors, not least of which is Chadwick Bozeman's performance.

An orange grown in florida and shipped to Georgia never crosses a border so tariffs don't affect the price, right?  Well, the company will still face fuel costs for running their field machinery, increase in packaging price which perhaps comes from an overseas manufacturer, repair parts for a shipping fleet that the orange company contracts to move their product, computer hardware to run their financial software, software licenses to track payroll...

Even if you could find some singularly unique hypothetical product where no part of the process required anything from another country, the fact remains that everything else has gone up in price.  People in that industry will demand higher wages to account for the inflation, and that means the price of that item will also increase.  If I make $150k a year measuring the interior diameter of completely domestic widgets (and measuring widget ID is a skilled labor position), AND everything is 5% more expensive, my employer had better give me a 13% raise this year instead of the usual 8, or I'm going to start looking for a new job.

You're talking about edge cases. To begin with, this isn't a situation faced by any but a handful of novelists. Most novelists will make no money on any of their novels.

It wouldn't save the production that much money if they didn't have to pay for the rights to a novel.

reddit,"It's horrible and it speaks entirely to a problem running rampant in film graphics both on-screen and in marketing today -  studios are over-reliant on shared stock libraries and graphic artists put against tight deadlines and budgets to produce material that leads to this cheap, assembly line look of things like a film's poster. 

Created artistic elements in our studio movies, whether the fictional company logo in the background of a shot or the poster you see in a theater lobby, are primarily comprised of stock artwork from a relatively small number of stock libraries composited together with still shots of the actors (sometimes even certain body parts like arms and hands, hair, etc. are stock art).

Studio cost-cutting and truncated timelines from production to the marketing campaign of films nowadays have become the death of hand-drawn posters and elements. Marketing campaigns may have a few weeks to churn out initial posters now once they receive elements or review the film themselves (if ever). A lot of times, they're working blind off little more than a synopsis. 

These posters are usually not even created by the studios themselves but funneled through shared vendors, which is also relatively limited, who are put against tight deadlines to produce these elements. This leads to a lack of creativity and further reliance on pre-rendered elements (stock).

The silver-lining is that some films do eventually receive hand-drawn posters from actual artists, especially in the last month leading to its release, that carry more of the creative fingerprint of the finished product. You have to keep an eye out for these posters though - a lot of times they're limited to a specific theater chain or an in-person promo screening. 

TL;DR: there probably won't be an end to this generic style of poster from the major studios due to shortened marketing windows and the almighty dollar.",0.0094006568144499,music

My issue with the movie was the build up to the situation and the building up of the characters was good. Excellent writing. I was anticipating and looking forward to what’s about to happen. 

However, the whole third act was very straight forward and predictable. It looks like first draft. Should have rewritten it atleast another couple of times. 

Action was very ordinary.  They found a weakness against bad characters  and they failed to use it properly. 

The third act actually need some more twists and turns and the ending shouldn’t have been just all hands off conflict. So brain dead and Amateur writing. I am quite shocked the studio ok’d it.  

The most important weakness to me is the villain. The guy was ok but he didn’t have the charisma to pull it off to be that menacing. Would have been better if it was played by another popular actor.  

The very end part after everything is over that happens several years later is a saving grace for the movie. 

If they nailed the parts above the movie would have been an all time classic instead of a movie you won’t remember after 2025.

I watch a lot of movies foreign and Hollywood and Hollywood has been seeing a steady decline in writing. Movies like this this should be rated a 7 is now 8 in IMDb. The audience also have pretty low bar now for good movies since the quality of writing has been not so good. The one thing me and my wife agreed was the rating. 

There is no chance this movie will be an 8 once it releases in streaming or paid streaming.

Either way Hollywood is getting lazy. This aren’t out of ideas but they are getting complacent. At a time where it’s so difficult to get audience to the theatre one would assume that more effort goes into writing but it doesn’t look that way.",0.0903174603174603,race

reddit,"The director of *Sinners* knew that it was time to break out of his comfort zone, David Sims writes.⁠

Ryan Coogler has made five movies, all of them well-received hits—especially *Black* *Panther* and its sequel, which became a cultural phenomenon and a high-water mark for Marvel. *Sinners*, a strange, heady piece of horror set in the Jim Crow Deep South, is his first entirely original work. He tells Sims that the film “came from a place inside of myself I wasn’t sure existed.”⁠

⁠“I got afraid, bro,” Coogler said. “Because when you’re working with other things, there’s also something to hide behind a little bit. It takes quite a bit of the pressure off. And the reality is, you’re less exposed if somebody doesn’t like it.” He continued: “I didn’t want to get caught up in the comfort of not being fully exposed. I didn’t want to look back at myself and say, ‘Man, I was chickenshit.’ So I went for it with this one.”⁠

Coogler called *Sinners* a love letter to a blues-obsessed uncle from Mississippi, and wanted the film to “feel like you were reading ‘Salem’s Lot’ while listening to the best blues record.”⁠

“This music is maybe our country’s greatest homegrown contribution. I had no idea of the epic nature of what was made in this place at this time,” Coogler said, “that became global pop culture. That was just flat-out astonishing, to think that these people that weren’t even considered full human beings by the state could make an art form that’s such a lightning rod.”⁠

Coogler had faced doubts when making *Black* *Panther*, among them that a film with a predominantly Black cast wouldn’t do well overseas. “That brings this full circle—like, the music made by a Black sharecropper with a guitar,” he told Sims. “How am I going to take that to Sweden? But there you have it. Everything you’re saying is true, and I believe in the value of the media. I don’t think it goes away. I pray it doesn’t. I love walking into a dark room with a bunch of strangers and a trailer rolling. The movie starts, and shit gets weird, and you hear people react to it. I love that feeling.”⁠⁠

Scots Irish people would not have considered themselves Irish. They are the descendants of Scottish colonial settlers who undertook the plantation of Ulster. This is when the British crown transferred land ownership from the native Catholic Irish population to a colonial Protestant Scottish population. Laws were put in place to prevent Catholics owning land and a systemic attempt was made to eradicate the Irish language and culture. This has present day ramifications in the existence of Northern Ireland, where there remains a cultural divide between mostly Protestants who would describe themselves as British, and mostly Catholics who would describe themselves as Irish (this divide has become less pronounced in recent years). 

Obviously, that’s not to say Irish Catholics didn’t go on to be racist in America, but in this situation I felt the film made them Scots Irish to accentuate an attempting to draw a commonality between people of Irish and West African descent, both in their history but also their musical culture.",0.0413333333333333,

reddit,">This right here is why you should always lift the embargo early if you think you got a great movie.

Honestly, embargos period are way outdated, and have been for awhile.

**Social media reactions are pointless**, and don't do shit in terms of driving tickets. They're empty blurbage that nobody pays attention to, from people nobody actually reads or follows. It's essentially just studios subsidizing freeloading would-be ""influencers"" who don't actually influence anyone (great ""work"" if you can get it) So ""embargoing"" their reactions is useless because even when they drop, it doesn't matter in terms of pushing tickets. The only use they serve are for the people at paid outlets, who get to scrape their low-effort, low-engagement posts into a content paste and run that mid-afternoon for their quota, to get shared places like this, where nobody really clicks it, they just use it to spark comment threads

**Critical reactions** ***do*** **mean way more, but the act of embargoing them is also pretty pointless,** not only due to the depressed media literacy that we're dealing with in general (nobody really reads at all anymore, LOL - most folks don't actually have a critic they can point to as someone they give a shit about anyway, much less read regularly) but due to the fact critical reception has been boiled down to the Rotten Tomatoes score, which isn't even ""boiled down"" so much as it is completely diluted by hundreds and hundreds of complete nobodies and absolute hacks that have zero business being counted as critics. Which doesn't matter because, again, nobody reads them anyway.

So we're basically talking about **when the score hits vs when it doesn't hit** (because nobody cares about the particulars of what the score means or what it's made of anyway) and the truth is **the score is only valuable for the 2nd weekend anyway, since weekend 1 is full of people who honestly don't give a shit what critics say regardless, right?** Weekend 1 is wholly about whether the marketing sold the movie correctly. And even then - like, Minecraft just happened. Scores still only mean so much.

Either way... embargoes is just an outdated ritual/exercise from a time when this whole reviews/free advertising thru press cycle was an actual thing way more than it is now. It's a lot harder to actually get that cycle to spin up when the fourth estate is basically bleeding out in a ditch and has been for the last 10+ years, LOL.",0.0803925736961451,music

At the end of the day, if Sinners does solid business at the box office (hopefully a solid hold the second weekend) and it can remain in the conversation over the next month or so, Coogler will be back at WB. Especially if Snners does well in the ancillary market. 

I'll be seeing it tomorrow but I've had a few buddies see it early and they really, really liked it. They all say that they'll see it again in theaters and buy the blu ray. They talk like all actors gave a great performance but they thought Delroy Lindo was the standout.

They're hoping WB will campaign for him to get a Best Supporting nod.

There are vast differences between audience of today and even the audience of 10 years ago. Originals use to be something that could compete with existing franchises. It was also easier to launch new IP as audiences were more willing to try something new. I also think audiences respected the artistry involved more where now they don't care.

In the day of Twitter, TikTok, and even more influencial in this case, Netflix and various other things, audiences are looking for different things in entertainment. They aren't looking for art.

Modern audiences see less and less value in the theatrical experience. And that's a hard problem to figure out. How do you get them to want or find that value, without losing artistic integrity that I'm sure many of the talent involved want to maintain. 

It's a very difficult thing to figure out, because the creative talent is often looking to make art, but audiences aren't looking for that, at least not the masses. They just want content to consume. But they don't seem to feel the need to consume it at the theater unless it's an event, which is often driven by IP and current trends, which a marketing team can't just manufacture that. So there's a lot involved that you can't just push the blame onto the marketing team. A lot of it is consumer behavior, which is something that a marketing team cannot forcibly change.",0.1223958333333333,
reddit,"It doesn't have to be one or the other. There is of course room for nuance. I'm not saying it's 100% on audiences. There are a lot of factors in play here. Economics, politics, Studio management, etc. But consumer behavior is a big factor here. 

But it has to be understood that whether or not studios take risks is not necessarily the fault of the studio. It is a business after all. Their goal is to make money. They do that as they react to modern consumer behavior. If audiences won't take the risk to pay $10 to see an original, why should they take the risk to spend millions to make one. That isn't exactly a great business strategy to continue to double down on original filmmaking when they get rejected time and time again regardless of quality. That's a good strategy to lose money. Originals only work in current market place on a smaller scale. Mid range and high range originals are near impossible to find success with unless you attach Nolan to it.

Now to your point IP doesn't guarantee success. That is true. But it does seem to be the only way to achieve large scale successes which is why Hollywood continues to try . When Disney remakes are successful that is consumer behavior that tells Disney there is an audience for it so they greenlight more. So why do some work and some don't. Lots of reasons. But primarily because not all IP is created equally. A remake of Snow White is going to generate less excitement than remake of the Lion King. Disney should have known that and that is on them. But Snow White was also surrounded with controversy from the beginning that kept escalating and getting worse all the way until release. So it's hard to know what potential it had. So maybe there is a world that could have been successful. We could dive into each of your examples and look at why they failed, but the reason will never be because audiences are tired of sequels and remakes or IP driven film, even if they say that. Because consumer behavior tells us and the studios otherwise, which is why Hollywood continues to do it. Because when it pays off, it does so in a major way. IP is what gets them the big money. 

For studios, they do often learn the wrong lesson or don't quite understand consumer behavior in terms of what projects they should or should not pursue. But ultimately, from my perspective, success in film comes when a film is able to achieve event status. So they have to look at what IP generates the most conversation, what IPs have the potential to become events. This is hard to just manufacture on the studios end. Trends come and go quickly so it's very hard to determine what could blow up. But IP is really the best place to start to find that potential. It's what is the main driver that builds things into event like moments, certainly moreso than quality or originality. Consumer behavior, year after year, continues to reinforce this as it is only sequels, remakes and IP driven films that see large scale success with very little exception. Quality doesn't seem to matter much. It just needs an IP that makes audiences excited enough to show up.",0.1085418407128933,

reddit,"Vampires in the traditional sense are closer to 30-40% of the film & serve as an artistic expression of hive mind thinking, exploitative evil, etc (how you interpret the film).

The movie was more of a representation of a people not far removed from the harshest existence in American history & trying to find their way with the systemic fangs (vampires) still present all around them yet still finding inspiration & beauty in harsh conditions.

This was communicated through sharecropping.

In the movie and in the south in reality sharecropping was paid through plantation credits (fake money).

many would say this is slavery. 

Paying workers in fake money while you benefit from their work financially is a metaphor of vampires sucking life force from their victims but the vampires in that situation were the people who benefited from the hard workers as they made them wealthier.

As for whether the movie is “anti-Christian” I don’t think it is. I don’t even think it’s anti-religion.

Everyday white liberals who claim to be ""ally""s undermine the intelligence of the people they claim to be allies with and do things against the best interest of the people they claim to be allies with. There's a history of Asian entrepreneurs having dubious relationships with the Black communities they serve (one example depicting such is the 1989 film ***""Do the Right Thing""***).

You're introducing stuff to make your point, saying it ""wouldn't have made a difference"" is wrong. >!The dozens of people didn't give info about the daughter.

reddit,"Your reply is absolutely stupid and I feel dumber for reading it. The entire film is situated against the broader white narrative. Coogler’s entire oeuvre is about providing a Black counter narrative or at least presenting the Black perspective where it has been erased. 
This film is doing the same thing- how many Black vampire films are there? Not many. So this film is providing that perspective against the “regular” or white perspective. Additionally, we get a glimpse of the Choctaw in there- another group that has been marginalized. If “my version” of the story was whitewashed, they wouldn’t have appeared at all. 
My point is that their story could’ve been expanded to provide some really rich context to vampire backstory in the Choctaw beliefs and folk story about vampires.

      OW * 11/4 legs [2.75 slightly above Nope] * 3/2 (2/3rds Domestic) = Breakeven
      33[OW]/8 = WWBO

So using 290/300M gives you a 70-73M OW while using a 55M OW gets you to $226M and the latter number is  completely uncontroversial extrapolation from the film's production budget. 

Replace WWBO with 2.5x budget and I've recreated a similar number to the initial puck breakeven claim from abstract principals with no claim to hidden knowledge.",-0.0583333333333333,music

Reading that, again is says nothing about what deal he actually got that that he had a laundry list of requests and was denied at other studios. He wanted final cut, which we can assume he got because that's not atypical. He wanted first dollar gross and he wanted ownership of the movie back after a set period. 

We have other producers, who don't work at WB and had no hand in the deal and don't know specific details, specifically bitching about WB not having complete ownership of the film. And we know he has *a* backend deal because money is being taken from it to cover the overrun on the budget. Doesn't say what the backend deal is so it *could* be a first dollar gross but back end deals and first dollar grosses are typically different, referenced differently and are paid out differently.

So we're left with, again, he gets the rights back after 25 years...maybe. They could've negotiated that to be bigger we just know that he's definitely going to get the rights back at some point. He got final cut presumably. And that he has some form of a backend deal, whether it's more Greta Gerwig x% after the movie makes y dollars or James Cameron/Nolan first dollar gross is anyone's guess.

So instead let me turn it around on you. When has Belloni ever just talked without the shit in front of it about WB? You've so graciously admitted he talked about them a lot, so what does he end up talking about?

The Town has something like 50k followers on Spotify, which is not the same as subscribers, which is also not the same as actual listeners. It's a pretty safe bet that the number of people who regularly consume the actual content of the pod on a weekly basis is closer to 15-20k total. Which is actually *pretty ok* for a podcast but fairly garbage for what people tend to THINK these podcasts should be getting in terms of listenership. (this is partially why a push to YouTube is a BIG fucking deal at Spotify the past few months)

Belloni apparently does not get a check from either Spotify or Ringer for his podcast, and the only reason I am hedging that bet is because I do not know if there is some weird under-the-table thing happening that nobody is privy to. But *publicly* neither he, nor Spotify, nor Ringer, list him as a paid employee of either Ringer or Spotify. He has a show on the network and that is it - that said I would not imagine the listenership that Belloni is pulling with his show would be considered worth any check, under-the-table or otherwise, they'd be issuing. 

People presume Bill Simmons chose him but Simmons, upon selling The Ringer to Spotify, no longer really controls The Ringer, or makes a lot of its programming decisions. Sean Fennessey basically runs the podcast network in terms of content management, although Simmons is still ""the guy.""

reddit,"An interesting perspective, regarding why they spend so much on their newest films:

> Hollywood veterans as both producers and former co-chiefs of the film division at MGM, DeLuca and Abdy are renowned for their deep relationships with visionary moviemakers and long connection to prestige moviedom. Hired by Warner Bros. Discovery’s movie-killing, “not artist friendly but artist aware and adjacent” CEO, David Zaslav, to revitalize Warner Bros. in 2022, the duo’s mandate included remedying the studio’s ugly reputation around town for sacrificing talent to the bottom line. Abdy and DeLuca quickly made their mark green-lighting big-budget projects for a stable of esteemed, if not consistently bankable, auteurs: $130 million for Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another (a crime thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio), $80 million for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Bride! (reportedly a punk-rock art-house revision of The Bride of Frankenstein), $80 million for Saltburn writer-director Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights, and, of course, Coogler’s Sinners.

> “Warners is outpaying everyone for everything,” says our first executive. “The Wuthering Heights thing is a disaster; that’s crazy paying that for those rights! The attitude at Warners is ‘Our studio is in trouble. We’ve got to get it going. Do whatever.’ But whoever is running the studio in 25 years is not going to be Zaslav or Pam and Mike. So [the Sinners deal] is a short-term decision to help the financial quarter out, to help the year out, to help them relaunch. It’s just that these short-term decisions have long-term effects. They don’t think, Well if you do this, the studio system is going to be gone. Not thinking of the ramifications.”",0.003720238095238,

reddit,"I think the point is missed here. I actually think the economics of film are missed here.

When someone invests in a movie they are locking up capital for 3-5 years. From 2010-2022, investors were willing to invest in film because the rate of return elsewhere was so low due to zero interest rate policy.

Today, investors don't need to take the risk on cinematic productions. Safe/easy returns of 11-15% are achievable. Without taking on the risk of the film losing money. Without taking on the 3-5 waiting time.

There is no incentive for investor to take risk nor for a studio to take on the costs/risk of distributing and advertising unless the returns on the 5% of films that have a legacy is stays with them. These studios are hemorrhaging money now because they have massive debt and they can't refinance it at lower rates anymore.  Giving up the potential future returns is very much desperation.

People need to understand, people don't fund films because they like watching movies. They fund films because it makes a return on their investment. Sure, there are a few billionaires who fund passion projects so their daughter or wife can be in a movie but most investors want a return.

This article completely misses the reality here. The directors, studio executives, actors and entertainment media are all completely missing the point.

Robert Downey Jr is not playing Doom because he wants to return. He is playing Doom because he was the investor in Dr. Doolittle. And lost a whole lot of money when it bombed.

Hollywood got used to cheap money and forgot how to make a good product. Creatives have expectations that can't be met, the audience has expectations that can't be met, the entertainment media are by-and-large just mouth pieces for studio and creative publicists and most everyone is in denial. Films are not good business anymore. Filming in the US is not good business anymore. This goes beyond just the attention span problem.

Sinners could have been made for $40M. It should have been made for $40M. Sinners is targeting a market that frankly speaking does not exist outside of the US. And barely exists in the US. A period piece, graphic horror film set in the South.

There is no data analytics out there that says that market is large enough for a $110M budget film.

The only negative is the film only has a 27% white audience currently. Over 50% of it's audience is African American. An R-rated horror film only having a 27% white audience for ticket buyers might harm it's legs since African American audiences don't historically fuel domestic horror film box office.

I'm not surprised that the white audience participation is so low. It's the state of the America we live in. Hopefully the solid Asian, and Latino numbers combined with the African American audience numbers will be strong enough to make it a success in spite of the lack of white American movie goers.

What I'm saying is that audience showed up for these original movies in droves cause north of 250M WW is big boxoffice...unless your budget is too big. Peele movies that earned 256M each cost 4M and 20M.

We'll see what happens but OW tracking looks promising enough to push domestic total well over 100M when all is said and done.

Also it's a lot of folks here (not saying you, your arguments up and down the thread are clearly thought through and fair) who seem to be very clearly, for lack of a better term, **concern trolling** over the fact the movie cost 80-90mil.

""But the budget"" seems to be literally the whole of the battle cry, basically, for why they don't wanna hear about how this could actually break out, as it appears to be in the progress of building up *to* that break out.

If *Gareth Edwards* had made this shit last year, or two years ago even, for 85 mil, **I can guarantee** not a single person up in this thread wringing their hands about the budget would be doing anything but talking about what a fucking miracle it was, that a drop-dead gorgeous Ultra Panavision and IMAX combo epic genre film about vampires got made for **ONLY 85mil,** and they cant wait to spend their money.

But for some reason, ever since trailer one of this thing, all folks up in here have been wanting to talk about is: how weird/dumb it is that this movie has a budget of 90 mil and why would anyone have given Ryan Coogler that much money to make this?

It's happening all up and down this thread, and most threads about this flick, even *after* the review thread dropped and it was almost completely positive, and even after the Coogler video about all the different formats they were releasing it in dropped and a 5min clip starring *a director* talking *about film sizes* became a legitimate thing.

The GA is clearly getting a lot more interested in the movie the closer it gets to opening, and still a lot of folks are fixated on that question:

>If Gareth Edwards had made this shit last year, or two years ago even, for 85 mil, I can guarantee not a single person up in this thread wringing their hands about the budget would be doing anything but talking about what a fucking miracle it was, that a drop-dead gorgeous Ultra Panavision and IMAX combo epic genre film about vampires got made for ONLY 85mil, and they cant wait to spend their money.

Gareth Edwards knows how to maximize a budget. The Creators only costed 80 million and there are films over 200 million that look far worse. I'm not sure what Sinners is doing to demand a higher budget than a sci-fi film. Granted I'm avoiding spoilers and have only watched the first trailer. 

>But for some reason, ever since trailer one of this thing, all folks up in here have been wanting to talk about is: how weird/dumb it is that this movie has a budget of 90 mil and why would anyone have given Ryan Coogler that much money to make this?

I mean it is crazy/weird. I'm glad they took such a crazy swing. Before the reviews dropped I thought this film was dead on arrival. If the film is really that good, I expect word of mouth to carry the film to a break even point at least.

But to say that people are weird or dumb because they find enjoyment in something while knowing what's coming is ridiculous. 


You can be much more aware of foreshadowing and dramatic irony by having knowledge that the characters don't have. Rather than trying to follow plot, you can take more interest in the characters and themes. 


Lastly, in order for the movie to even be made, they have to convince studios to back it and actors to be a part of it. Obviously as part of that, they will have to share ""this is what's going to happen"" and those people they get on board think ""that sounds great, I'd like to be a part of it"" and are probably pretty interested in the finished result despite knowing all the information ahead of time.


There's so much more to appreciate about a movie than plot points. The writing, acting, cinematography, and how it all comes together is much more important than having twists and surprises. 


People get very excited about adaptations of books, comics or past movies they're already familiar with. Not because they're hoping there's new surprises, but to see another perspective on work they already enjoy and want to engage with more. 


It's bizarre to me that people can see a trailer that's just a couple minutes long and say it's pointless to see a movie that's 90-120 long because they think they know everything there worth knowing about it from a few parts shown without context (that may not even end up being in the movie or is in a completely new light based on additional context not given in the trailer).

Some people want to know literally nothing and potentially the most famous example is Terminator 2. Spoiler alert: Arnie is good now. That while technically a spoiler and a twist on Terminator 1 was fundamental to the plot of the movie so I wouldn't actually class that as a spoiler. 

On the border of this category you could include Harrison Ford in Blade Runner 2049. That could have been kept secret and for some that would have been a real pain to find out, but I'd put that into the category of necessary for marketing and getting people into the cinema. 

Category 2 you'd put into those that could be detrimental to storytelling if you've already seen the trailer. Examples of Tom Hanks being saved in Castaway, Gwen Stacy's death in TASM2, even in Kingsmen: Golden Circle Matthew Vaughan spoke out that he would have rather kept back that Colin Firth was still alive. Those are the ones which are counter intuitive where they ruin an emotional beat of a film. 

For this trailer you'd easily say that Hailee Steinfeld being a vampire isn't an unnecessary trailer plot point, I'd agree that's probably an early beat to the movie that's telling you it's a vampire movie (See Mel Gibson in Payback with turning the ransom against the kidnappers), that sets the tone for a cinema goer, but MBJ's twin self turning ruins the peril.",0.1240740740740741,music

Take something like Creed. He didn't just deliver a hit. He relaunched a franchise, that was fully linked to a specific actor in a specific role. 

And he was able to hand that over to other filmmakers to take over installments.

We'll see what happens with Black Panther, but I feel like Wakanda has been created so fully as a world, that the MCU should be able to find a director who can take over for future instalments if needed.

1. keep it rolling with original stuff, given he's unique as one of the very few young filmmakers who managed to strike gold with franchises early on in his career, and 

2. step out of the shadow of Michael B. Jordan. Their partnership has been hugely beneficial for both a la Socrsese and De Niro/Dicaprio, but it'd be a great test of Coogler as a filmmaker to not have to rely on him for every lead part in case it becomes tiring or a bit of a meme for the GA.

>It's not a gotcha when directors build up their resumes to be handed a tentpole film that has a good odds of success and they can show off their skills/vision.


Again when did I say that's a gotcha?


What are you even arguing here?


My point was that a director making successful Franchise films does not prove that they can make Successful Non IP films.


Case in point. The Russos. They are incredible Marvel directors.
But they failed to Make a successful movie.


I never said that there is anything wrong with a director making Franchise films or even only Franchise films.


My point was that if a Director has made the majority of his successful movies in Franchises then I can't consider him a Big name Director like I would Nolan or Cameron or Tarantino.
Because said Director has not proven they can make successful movies without the backing of Franchises.


>Nolan had to make 3 cultural defining films (TDK, TDKR, Inception) before he became a household name. It's not an easy feat and takes a long time. Plus luck.


Plenty of Directors make Culture Defining movies and then follow them up with failures or underperformances.


Both Se7en and Fight Club were culture defining and yet future David Fincher films still failed.


The Matrix movies were Culture Defining and yet their Future movies failed.


The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was Culture defining and yet King Kong was an underperformance at best and The Lovely Bones was a flop.


And I would argue that The Russos in their own right made Culture defining films with Infinity War and Endgame and yet all of their future Non Marvel projects failed.


What Nolan did was make a Super successful Original Film in Inception immediately after TDK proving he could make both successful Franchise moveis and successful Original movies. ",0.2766369047619047,

Batman was my immediate thought and I was kinda surprised to see so many side, or decidedly ""marginalized,"" characters suggested in the comments.

I always thought X-Men would do well in his hands in the MCU. 

Not to mention, between Black Panther and Creed, I feel he's handled villains pretty well, which would be important with Batman's rogues. I could see his Bruce (which is also as important to me as Batman) be intriguing, too.

Fruitvale Station, on the other hand, was OOP last time I checked. ""Overlooked debut of a now-beloved director"" is firmly in Criterion's wheelhouse.

That said, I don't know if we're getting any Coogler in the collection at all. A lot of folks incorrectly assume that an appearance in the Criterion Closest correlates with an imminent release featuring that artist, but the evidence doesn't bear that out.

Other than Disney and a few event films big domestic openings are a thing of the past. Why would you rush to see sinners at theaters when you know it’ll be on Max soon? And if you aren’t a max subscriber you can wait for Netflix. 

I don’t stream recent movies, my free tubi and freebie subscriptions plus my on and off Netflix keep me entertained plus my huge physical library of books and movies. I go to see every new release that plays in my area. Double features every Sunday, mostly matinees. 

But many people around me rarely go to theaters and even less opening weekend. 

Disney is smart. They keep long theatrical runs. Sony didn’t bankrupt film divisions in a lame attempt to try to take from the Netflix pie. 

Universal and WB are shooting themselves in the foot. Digital release and short theatrical windows is quick bucks but it’s hurting  the long term value of their films. And not hurrying to get a Barbie sequel and not releasing Bridget Jones on theaters is only indication of laziness by the big studio heads.
Paramount streaming is not drawing big numbers either and their only franchises are Sonic and MI. They could have done more for both.

I'm not saying they're greedy, but there is a bidding war culture inside Hollywood (also see: Zach Cregger getting 20 million dollars to direct his next movie) of scaling up too far in budget because of the perceived value of a filmmaker. Every studio is trying to capture the ""next big thing"" so they're wildly overpaying for it when a potential ""next big thing"" arrives. I've worked in Hollywood for a while. The most prevailing sentiment I have learned is that things cost way more than they should OR they cost way less than they should. The reason they cost more is that at some moment the heat around a person involved forced the hand of the studio or financier to back up a brinks truck to win the day against the other studios. The reason they cost less is every other example, the heat wore off so it required a Sisyphean effort of creative concessions and budget cuts to even get the movie considered.  

WB did this overpay for Sinners (they were also the only studio to offer Coog the ownership he was asking for), they did it for Weapons (cost way too much!), and it's not the next big thing, but they did it for PTA too. 

I will greatly enjoy these movies, but WB spent that amount of money to beat the other studios.

This is the problem with Yellowjackets. It's turning into a show about a bunch of sociopaths. There is nobody to root for anymore. Yes the Sopranos and Breaking Bad had villains in main roles but there were other people to root for like Jesse on BB. I wouldn't mind if all the characters on Yellowjackets are killed off except maybe Jeff. 

Speaking of WB this article was interesting. 

>Despite its funky double-De Niro hook, ""The Alto Knights"" grossed a paltry $3.2 million over its March 21 opening weekend, coming in sixth behind the loudly lamented bomb ""Mickey 17"" in its third frame. Granted, it cost $68 million less than Bong's movie, but with a sizable marketing spend and dicey pedigree, it's a far more embarrassing failure. The once great Barry Levinson (also a member of the Hamptons lunch bunch) hadn't helmed a theatrical release in a decade and, worse, hadn't knocked out a watchable studio flick since 2001's ""Bandits."" 

It's impressive how easy it is for older men in Hollywood who haven't had any profitable movies in decades to get massive budgets while very few female writers and directors get over a $100M budget. Even after Furiosa and Gladiator 2 underperformed the directors will get a massive budget for their next movie.

reddit,"Hi - I am genuinely sharing this out of curiosity, not criticism of the movie or other movies I mention or people that love them.

I’m a 29-year-old biracial woman - half Black, half white - first in my family with a bachelor’s degree, working as a middle school teacher. My friends and family span a wide range of races, genders, and income levels. Maybe because of my background and my own experiences with anxiety, depression, and various kinds of racial, gender, class, and sexual trauma  I often find today’s popular horror trauma films, like Sinners, Anora, Get Out, Men, Civil War, Promising Young Woman, Babygirl, Wifelike, Subservient, The Substance, etc. hard to connect with and emotionally exhausting/traumatizing to watch.

To me, they often feel harsh, divisive, dark, strangely joyless - sometimes even mean-spirited and anxiety/trauma-inducing. And even though I seem to match almost all the identity groups these films are meant to reflect or empower, I often find myself retraumatized by them and wondering… who enjoys or feels empowered by these movies?

I’ve just noticed how dominant this genre has become - while stories that feel warm, hopeful, funny, or life-affirming seem harder and harder to find. And I find myself genuinely curious: why do so many critics and film lovers gravitate toward these kinds of movies?

Especially since it seems many of the people championing them are often well-off, highly educated, and living stable, relatively calm lives with a happy marriage and kids they love to talk about (Sean and Amanda). Why do people with so much peace and and wealth and security in their own lives seem so captivated by stories of chaos, pain, and trauma? Do this stories of trauma allow them to escape from their lives while it reminds me of the painful memories of mine?

Sometimes, it feels like films about race, gender, and trauma are being treated as edgy or stylish by critics and filmmakers, rather than being handled with care or empathy for the people who lived through these things. But I want to understand, not assume.

So if you love these types of movies, I’d really love to hear:

 - What do you get from them emotionally or artistically?
- Do they make you feel seen, challenged, inspired?
- Do they help you process something in your life - or bring awareness to issues that need to be faced?
- Is there something personal (background, identity, worldview) that makes these stories resonate for you?


Just trying to understand why these movies are so traumatizing for me and my family and my friends and why other people and critics seem to give them 99/100, A+ movie of the year feedback. Would love to hear your thoughts and perhaps understand your worldview!",0.1609629629629629,race

The Creed movies work as sports movies and hits all the traditional individual hero’s journey stuff. Black Panther works as a superhero movie. And works as a vampire movie independent of whatever themes that one could seek out in it.

I actually do agree with your point about the abundance of “trauma” movies. It sometimes feels like most of the horror movies that come out are about the monster being an obvious representation generational trauma. But the reasons people/critics gravitate towards movies like this one is because those are what the best filmmakers in Hollywood are making, and those movies are typically very good. As for why Ryan Coogler, Jordan Peele, or Martin Scorsese want to make these kind of movies, you’d have to ask them.

It was Mary who made a move to reunite with the man she loved, Annie knew exactly what she wanted and it was to not exist as a vampire which is why Smoke ending her life was not him showing her mercy but exercising her will and Grace, when she realised that all was as good as lost, just decided to not live a fuck at all and go all out taking down as many vampires as they could. 

And that, here, is the trick. There is no arbitrary method of writing a good female character for we all have to discover it on our own.

Oh my god I loved this film. This is such a treat in Imax (for me much more than Oppenheimer, but maybe I’m alone on that) the sound, visuals especially with the aspect ratio changes were amazing. The actors did their job well, shoutout to MBJ, playing to characters and reacting to your own acting cannot be easy. 

I loved the story too, there were so many funny moments I wasn’t expecting. The crowd I had was mostly black, hearing the reactions had me cracking up by itself (I think I heard a loud-ish “Damn, nigga just jumped” when Remmick first started levitating to chase Mary after she turned and left. “Get back the fuck inside” when they were dragging the dude’s body out when he was dead and they were just standing outside) I love my people lmao.

Also Kudos to Annie being smart as fuck, knowing that they were vampires, urging to get Stack’s body outside before he woke up, making sure everyone ate the garlic so there’d be no surprises, and telling Smoke to kill her before she turns if she gets bit. I’m glad she’s back with her baby in the end :’) 

And the music, oh my god the music. The scene in the Jukebox where Sammie is playing and musicians from the past and future make an appearance, god I felt like hearing that made me ascend (also was that a long take? I remember the camera panning towards the roof which was on “fire” and it zoomed out to Remmick and the white folk he turned). I need the soundtrack for the score to be out now but it releases at midnight, I’ll just suffer until then

I was not expecting that scene at the end with the credits, made me and everyone else in the theatres perk the fuck up real quick (there were so many audible “oh shit”s being spoken) but I enjoyed it heavily. 

Preacher Boy Sammy did end up driving the car on the way back, just not the way he expected to :( 

Notable lines for me (or ones I just remember from memory): 

“I think I shat myself”

“Oh he busy huh?”

“Fuck your wife”

“German Trenches Nigga” 

“Nah fool it’s Jim Crow, open the door”

“We believe in equality” or some shit like that 

I’ve seen this movie twice already but I think I’m gonna rewatch it like 6 times to beat my record lol. That and to soak up more of this movie, but for now I’m rating it a 9/10.

reddit,"I know there are so many themes jam-packed into this film that we could be talking about each one for hours, but I really wanted to mention one that I thought was extremely poignant and I haven't seen discussed: the dangers of cultural assimilation.  

The vampires promise eternal life, but this is a lie.  The purported “eternal life” is really the theft of freedom.  The false narrative that has perpetuated throughout American society for the past several centuries has always been that, in order to “survive,” groups must abandon parts of themselves and their culture to come into the “modern age"" (think of the terrible history of forcing Native American children into assimilation boarding schools, which I can't help to tie to Remmick's introduction). But to make this transition, groups are told to abandon their heritage.  They lose their culture and their history.  This is the ultimate deprivation of freedom.   This is emphasized by Stack in the mid-credits scene, when he confirms that the day before he became a vampire was the last time he felt truly free.

Remmick is trying to build a “cult” of sorts.  He is attempting to create a shared experience.  But it is really a theft of freedom.  He is destroying something good to build his own thing, but those that are stolen are not happier.  As is repeated several times, vampires are the worst type of monster.  They trap your soul deep within.  They take the truest and most integral part of you and force you to hide it deep down, out of sight.

reddit,"Y’all, I’m not gonna bury the lede here. Sinners is a 10/10, it’s the best thing I’ve seen in a long while. It’s everything I want in a movie. It’s super badass, it’s sexy, it’s funny, it’s mystical, it makes wild choices, it pulls no punches, it’s a period piece, a musical, a horror film, a social commentary. It never stops being the most insane and awesome vampire movie while the themes run deep through every scene. This is exactly the kind of best case scenario for Coogler who has spent the last decade plus making big studio IP films to kick down the doors and remind us he doesn’t need any of that to make a great fucking movie. 

There is a sequence in this movie that had me levitating out of my seat with tears down my face, and I struggle between not spoiling it here but wanting to discuss it in depth. But I do want to talk about what this movie is getting at, because it’s such a brilliantly nuanced conversation taking place in a legit vampire movie and neither ever feel forced together. On the surface it might be easy to compare this to a Peele film or say it’s all about race, but really it’s just as much about culture. This movie is about why creating space for furthering the culture through art is important. The sequence I’m referring to is a little abstract and it’s the first time this movie’s thesis really opens up, but it’s so incredible. Musically and visually and thematically it’s an absolute home run and feels like Coogler showing off what he’s had up his sleeve all this time. And the horror of this movie begins with the end of that sequence, when you see the three vampires watching these people have a great time and while it’s not stated out loud, the visual message here is that these boring cultural vampires cannot stand not being invited to join the party. And that’s about to ruin everyone’s night. 

I honestly feel like this movie does such a fantastic job of conveying its theme that I will do it a disservice here, but I’m going to try. The lore of this movie is that some people are so fucking good at making music that they awaken evil spirits to challenge them, which is already cool as hell. Sammie is the one the vampires want the most. Why? Because he’s culturally significant. The vampires want him to become one of their collective consciousness, sharing his music and talents with the monoculture. But these people that have worked so hard to carve out a space for themselves know Sammie is meant to enrich their specific culture, that’s why they're so protective of him and why Smoke basically threatens him to stay. It’s not about keeping anyone out, it’s about how when there’s plenty of places to go enjoy folk music or the mainstream, there should be no problem with there also being a space for the minority culture to thrive. 

And how about these vampires? This movie is hilarious as much as it is frightening, and the vampires being Irish sea shanty folk singers is maybe the funniest thing about it. I didn’t take it as a knock on any specific culture, but folk music like that is so dependent on synchronization and unity while the cultures being explored in that club music scene feels much more based in individuality and unexpected flavor. It’s so genius to make that the collective consciousness style and how their ultimate goal is to consume other cultural art to be one with their mainstream ideals. It actually works so well with the old lore of vampires, for example them needing to be invited in is so perfectly indicative of how personal it feels to not be invited into these spaces even if it’s for the purpose of preservation of the art. I love folk music, but what a great director does is show you their perspective and I can feel how Coogler feels when he hears it with this movie. 

And the cherry on top of this insane movie is how religion plays into it all. I think this is a little more buried in the text, but it is called Sinners and opens with a church so it was on my mind. In the climax when Sammie defaults to the Lord’s Prayer and the vampire starts reciting it too, something really clicked for me. Something about how organized religion is the original monoculture, forced upon people and now so deeply rooted that separating it from current culture is almost impossible. Sammie isn’t just fighting the idea of mainstream music and people trying to bite his lived-in style, he’s fighting his father who has religious expectations and sees his creativity as an obstacle stopping Sammie from being Godly. It’s a brilliant opening because of the vibe of that first scene, seeing Sammie go back home, my immediate thought was “oh look what the nightlife did to this boy” and after seeing the movie you know how important that night of playing was to him, how it wasn’t the club that destroyed him. 

This movie committing to the ending, having him clutch that guitar neck and drive away, it’s so powerful. The best thing we can do in this world is be true to our creativity, and this movie is all about that idea. Not to mention the loving eye this movie puts on the brief period where the brothers owned their own profitable business and gave their people a safe space to celebrate their culture, that really got to me. I believe the title, Sinners, refers to the creatives who reject any sort of monoculture and truly seek the unique, the art that could only come from them and their background, and it’s so brilliant because that’s what this movie is. Fully unique and only possible through the lens of the creative force behind it. Coogler is Iron Chef level cooking with this, arguing that being an artist/sinner is better than being a boring saint. 

Thematic poetic waxing aside, this movie just absolutely fucks. It’s so sexy and entertaining, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. It has some WILD dialogue but these actors sell the hell out of it, especially Hailee who has a really tough role with some insanely explicit lines that she sells so well. And with all these amazing and lived-in characters, this movie is not precious about keeping them alive or from turning. The build-up to the vamps getting invited in was so damn good, I was in tears when the shopkeeper screamed it out. And that shot of everyone grabbing weapons while the vampires  open that giant barn door, I swear you could have punched me in the fucking face and I wouldn’t have stopped watching. The swiftness with which that scene devolves into just death and massacre and violence is what a good climax is all about. Even if you’re not paying attention to the themes, this is a fully satisfying vampire horror extravaganza. 

I’m going to wrap this up, but I need to highlight how rare it is to really earn an ending like Michael B. Jordan mowing down racists. Like, it’s such a tropey blaxploitation revenge moment, but it feels amazing with those guitar riffs and with everything leading up. In maybe this movie's most brilliant turn, the vampires aren’t even the most evil characters. At least they offer some semblance of a life, and I really don’t think this movie damns the vampires fully as much as sees them as a naturally occurring obstacle to overcome in order to keep cultural identity unique. No, the real villains of this movie are the Klan racists, and it can be argued that the most convincing argument the vampires make for assimilation is how the racists were going to kill everyone anyways. Why not join mainstream culture and go on to turn the racists into vamps as well? So it feels earned and oh so right when the racists show up for the final scene and get what’s coming from an angry Jordan who had lost everything except his guns.

This movie rocks but the ending plus the mid-credits scene blast this off into undeniably incredible territory. It sees the vampires with such empathy, in a way, and there’s real literary value in how the only survivors of the night are the artist and the entrepreneur, and how Smoke had to overpower his vamp brother in order to get them to leave Sammie alone. This is a movie that will be talked about and thought about for years and years, and I for one can’t wait to rewatch it a million times. Like I said, 10/10.

Stack and Mary, as we see at the end of the film, assimilate into wider ""white"" society and get to be together.  Stack solidifies this reading at the end when he tells Sammie that he can turn him into a vampire because living that way is ""less painfull"" (or w/e the exact wording is).  They've assimilated so their life is easier.  I don't even think the movie is super judgmental of them for this. It's not the ideal path, but it is A path that black people in America can take. They lose something for it, their deep connection to their cultural heritage, which is why they want Sammie to play like he used to for them, so they can reconnect with that part of them they gave up, but they also gain the ability to be together and lead what appears to be relatively happy lives.

Smoke represents the other side. He completely rejects assimilation.  Going down fighting, killing an entire KKK chapter. He gets to reunite with his loved ones in the afterlife, but he pays for it in blood.

Sammie is kinda the third path.  He holds onto his culture, but doesn't stay in the delta and become part of an equally poisonous/assimilative group, Christianity, that was also thrust upon them by white society. He takes his culture to Chicago and shares it with people, but also gets to protect it.  Smoke had to pay for Sammie to have that privilege in blood, which is made clear when Stack confirms to Sammie that the reason he never came for him (read: the reason he wasn't forced to culturally assimilate) is because Smoke made him promise he wouldn't.  The ability for Sammie to hold onto his heritage in the face of broader white culture assimilating everything comes from the sacrifices made by people like Smoke.

There are a ton of layers and they're all really fascinating.",0.1421497584541062,race

> In studying for this movie, I was studying Delta Blues music, and I discovered that for a long time, when the music business was first commodified in this country, genre itself was a tool of racism. If a black person sang a song and then a white person sang the same song, they would put those two songs into two different genres. The black song would be called a ""race record"", and the white person singing the song, that might be called ""bluegrass"".

> The music industry came before the film industry. It's an older industry, so a lot of the film business, it follows the whims of the music because it's an older industry. And that tradition is what causes certain genres to be kind of ghettoised, like *this* genre is beneath *this* genre, the horror movie is beneath the costume drama.

> So whenever I hear it with this one and I'm trying to define it, or when I'm trying to classify a movie like *Rosemary's Baby*...

 **Henry Zebrowski: ""I was thinking about that. What exactly would you call it? It has horror elements, but it's mostly a drama.""**

> Yeah, exactly. It becomes... you know, they had this ridiculous rule that the movie interrogates called the ""one-drop rule"" for human beings in this country at a time when they were trying to put apartheid on top of humanity. They said if you got one drop of black blood, that makes you black. Which is so absurd when you hear this.

> You think about that with movies, it's like ""Hey, you got a couple horror scenes, now it's a horror film."" And it's like, ""Well, is *Rosemary's Baby*?"" How are we going to talk about this movie, because the vast majority of it is a husband and wife talking to their neighbours.

> So for me, my favourite horror movies, they all are going to have an element of... a question mark, like ""Is that a horror movie?"" Because I'll tell you straight up, I think Steven Spielberg has created some of the most horrific images known to man, like with *Jaws*&mdash;

Although the scene is just as lively and just as infused with emotion as the earlier number, the key difference lies in the way the vampires operate. It's revealed that, despite each individual vampire insisting that they retain their human identity, they are all in thrall to the feelings of the vampire who made them, namely Remmick. Thus, the song they're happily dancing to is one from Remmick's past and upbringing, not their own. So, in this comparison, Coogler is showing us the difference between personal art, which primarily speaks to an individual (yet which can also be related to by myriad of other folks), and art which is deemed significant by an outside authority, whether that be a corporation, a cultural consensus, or otherwise.""",0.1704840613931523,

Remmick is, after all, NOT an individual, but already an amalgamation of previous individuals, and his philosophy is born from the weight of all of those experiences, and his goals are a result of that. 

He turns one, Mary, and her individual goals is almost immediately lost on the weight of the WHOLE of experiences Remmick represents. He isn't controlling her will, but the weight of new memories and experiences pushes her to the same goals.

But the more of the participants that are turned, the more of this family that are brought in, they start to reinforce each other in a way, and the shock of Annie being killed before she turns is enough to shock Mary, just like Elijah and Elias are able to have a private moment that overcomes those 'collective' view points.

So yeah, i agree with you; they're not controlled, but initially on being turned, the hunger and thirst they have as well as the overwhelming set of new experiences DOES appear to make them effectively pawns to Remmick's wants and needs, and they IMMEDIATELY start mirroring his personality more than their own.

I'm not 100% sure if I agree with the conclusion that they are a ""hive mind"" until Remmick is killed, or if they are merely shocked by Remmick's death enough to make them more themselves again.

Notably, this is Coogler's first truly original story, which frees him up to make a deal like this. Fruitvale Station is an adaptation of an actual man's death. Everything else he did prior to Sinners was a franchise movie. There was no chance he'd be able to retain ownership of an existing story or IP like that.

An absolutely killer soundtrack , with truly oscar winning performances from the leads. I'm still thinking about Sinners and *still* finding readings into the movie I didn't after leaving the theater days ago.

Nosferatu was a very good horror movie, filled with good scares and uncomfortable moments, using excellent usages of dream logic to make a detached nightmare sensation as you float through the movie, but that's all it is, is a good horror movie. You know what it's about, and there's very little layers to peel away. It prioritizes telling a faithful adaptation that's scary, and while it rushes a bit in the second act, it was a good film. Also good in the aesthetic, with great performances, but has less of a magical realism to the aesthetic and it's not like we're short period pieces from the era it's set in.

And there's nothing wrong with that, but Sinners made me feel triumphant, terrified, angry, and I cried (twice). That movie rattled me to my core. Nosferatu had me leaving the theater going ""that was a really good movie"".  Sinners had me going ""oh my god"" the entire ride home.

As for which movie I'd like to see, frankly I'd like both. Nosferatu is a *vampire* movie.

 The characters are just so real in Sinners. They joke with eachother about stuff that isn't a blatant 'okay audience its time to laugh lets look at the camera' way. My main complaint about movies these days is you don't get enough of a sense of who the characters are, or you just don't give a shit about them. These are all great, whole characters. Even the main vampire isn't just a blood thirsty monster who will stop at nothing to get what he wants - hes sad and misses his people, and he just wants that music power so he can see them again even if they are ghosts, especially since hes very much thousands of years old. But its also an interesting commentary on the parasitism of white people on black culture too. Also, its an interesting take on vampires - they're not quite a hive-mind but they all know and feel what the others know and feel, but they're all still very independent.

reddit,"Can’t really say I’m a fan of both, but Nosferatu. I think the Sinners had a lot of cool ideas for vampires, but the execution of some elements left a lot to be desired. The very last scene is fire tho, I’d watch that spin-off.",0.1375,
reddit,"Edit: PLUS there is a scene at the Juke Joint, not gonna tell it but it's THAT scene. It's so good, it transcends filmmaking and made me remember  why I love films.


Both are ABSOLUTE CINEMA.
Nosferatu for being a great Remake for a basically 100 year old film, also Robert Eggers is Kino.


And Sinners is great as an Original Film that isn't only a Vampire Film, but also a Film for and about the Black Community. The allegories and symbolism and metaphors is genius and no spoilers but I'm glad Ryan Coogler didn't go the route of making Remmick Le Allegory for Le Racism. But makes him a Victim of White Imperialism and shows what the Cycle of Violence and Racism does to someone.
How monstrous it makes a man. And how it spreads.
And the Film is about Black People losing their Communities and the spaces they make for themselves. The threat of having those Spaces invaded and corrupted by external forces.
Also Michel B. Jordan as the Twins is so good. They are so different from each other that it didn't seem like it was Michael. It was like they were actual brothers.",0.2300925925925926,race

reddit,"I prefer Nosferatu. 

I’d like to watch Sinners again. Since there’s details that I likely missed in the first viewing. So it’s definitely worth watching again. 

But I could see myself watching Nosferatu a lot more. I just love all the details that Robert puts into his movies. In a sea of pointless remakes, Nosferatu is a beautiful nod to the original. 

I’ll say that I enjoyed the vampires in Sinners. I also can’t get some of the songs out of my head. My main dislike of it actually boils down to Michael B Jordan’s performance. I have a hard time buying him as two different people. I also think the beginning drags on a bit too much.

reddit,"I agree about the hive mind, but while you could say that Nosferatu has it easier because its story is a lot more straightforward, I'm not sure about all the writing choices in Sinners... 

First of all, I think the movie struggles to give something to do to Miles... I get that the film has this magical realism bend and wants to represent a community and not just a sum of individuals, but a character as central to the narrative as Miles deserved more clear cut choices to develop a personnality (and not just some admittedly very exciting blues sequences)... And the KKK is element is too tacked-on. The film either should have established that peripheral threat more clearly when Remmick turns the couple in the beginning (a tense Tarantino-style conversation scene could have been great), or the characters in the barn should have asked more questions about Smoke and Stack's newfound venue... I understand Coogler trying to dissociate the threat of the vampire from the KKK to renew the meaning of the vampire and downplay the KKK's presence to avoid just doing another trauma porn set in the South but it does lessen ever so slightly the weight of Remmick's overall ideology when he explains it to the characters in the barn... 

As much as I love the way Sinners tries to remind us of the link between the epic and musicality through horror (it sets it apart from most horror films, even the very great ones), I think Nosferatu is more successful at what it's trying to do, which is to reduce the Dracula story to its most basic fairy tales elements and use visual storytelling to immerse us in the folklore surrounding the vampire mythos in Eastern Europe...",0.2857407407407407,
